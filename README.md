**grommunio Sync is an open-source application to synchronize Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) compatible devices such as mobile phones and tablets.**

_While Microsoft Outlook supports EAS, it is not recommended to use grommunio Sync due to a very small subset of features only supported. For Microsoft Outlook, users should rather use the native MAPI/HTTP and MAPI/RPC protocols, available through [grommunio Gromox](https://github.com/grommunio/gromox)._
